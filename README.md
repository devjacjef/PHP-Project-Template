## README.md

This is the code for my own personal website. I've allowed the code to be public on GitHub for anyone curious as to how I built my own website. Currently, I am only using features revealed to me by the standard PHP language and do not have plans to implement any third party dependencies. The goal is to better engage with PHP with the aspiration of becoming a backend developer.

**Code should be commented as to help understand what I have implemented**.
