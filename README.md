# Jack's PHP Project Template

*God, hell must really have frozen over for Jack to be coding in PHP.*

## README.md

This template is just a basic example of a 'well-structured' plain PHP project. At the time of writing this, I do not plan to use any dependencies/frameworks as I want to better engage with the language.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a good grasp of different subjects within Web Development.

**Code should be commented to show a good grasp of the subject and an overall understanding of what I am making.**
